# Product Box Assessment  

## Overview  
This is a simple frontend application built to meet the core requirements outlined in the assessment. The application allows users to add items, view them in a list, and manage them in a checkout cart.  

## Completed Tasks  
✅ Add items through the frontend application  
✅ Display a list of all items on the items page  
✅ Persist the number of items in the cart across different browser tabs  
✅ Ensure the checkout page shows the selected items  
✅ Maintain a clean and usable design/layout  

## Notes  
- The code is structured for readability, modularity, and scalability.  
- The core requirements have been fully implemented, but some additional tasks mentioned were not completed due to time constraints.  
- If needed, I am open to working on the additional tasks as well.
